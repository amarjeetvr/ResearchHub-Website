# 🔧 JWT Invalid Signature Error - Quick Fix

## Problem
You're seeing "JsonWebTokenError: invalid signature" because:
- The SECRET_KEY in `.env` was changed
- Old JWT tokens in browser cookies were signed with the old key
- Server can't verify tokens signed with a different key

## ✅ Solution (Choose One)

### Option 1: Clear Browser Cookies (Recommended)
1. Open browser DevTools (Press F12)
2. Go to **Application** tab (Chrome) or **Storage** tab (Firefox)
3. Click **Cookies** → `http://localhost:5173`
4. Find and delete the **token** cookie
5. Refresh the page and login again

### Option 2: Use Incognito/Private Window
1. Open new Incognito/Private window
2. Navigate to `http://localhost:5173`
3. Login fresh (no old cookies)

### Option 3: Clear All Site Data
1. In browser, go to: `http://localhost:5173`
2. Click the lock icon in address bar
3. Click "Site settings" or "Cookies"
4. Click "Clear data" or "Remove"
5. Refresh and login again

## 🔄 What Changed
- **Old SECRET_KEY**: `amar`
- **New SECRET_KEY**: `amar-jwt-secret-key-change-in-production-2024`

All existing tokens are now invalid and need to be regenerated by logging in again.

## 💡 Prevention
After clearing cookies and logging in with the new SECRET_KEY, the error will not appear again unless you change the SECRET_KEY again.

## ⚡ Quick Test
After clearing cookies, test login:
1. Regular login: `http://localhost:5173/login`
2. Admin login: `http://localhost:5173/admin/login`

**Status:** This is expected behavior after changing SECRET_KEY.  
**Action Required:** Clear browser cookies and login again.
